# .dotfiles

Inspired by some of the most awesome repositories for dotfiles, I've created this
one to help me with my helpful configurations and scripts

## Install

Run this:

```sh
cd ~
git clone <repository> .dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./script/install
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles`.

## Uninstall

In case you're tired of the current config:

```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
./scripts/uninstall
```
